## Pain vs. Suffering
- Pain is the price you pay when pursuing something you want. Suffering is pain without purpose.
- All growth comes with some degree of pain, as it pulls you out of your comfort zone.
The greater the growth, the greater the pain. But pain in the service of growth is a good thing,
as long as that pain is what’s necessary to achieve the growth that you’re aiming for. And even better than that,
this pain is only temporary. It’s what will launch you forward into the next phase of your life.
- You’ll have to research for hours on end, fleshing out the skeleton that we discuss in class, piling information on top of application so that you can reach your goals.
- ou’ll be pushed physically, and while sitting in a chair and staring at your screen isn’t the most strenuous exercise in the world, the consecutive hours of it will take its toll.
- suffering is pain without purpose. Pain with no higher goal. Pain with no dreams, no ambition, no aspiration.
## Big O notation
- Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm.
> Big O specifically describes the worst-case scenario, and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used (e.g. in memory or on disk) by an algorithm.
- ```O(1)``` (logarithmic algorithm) : describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set.
- ```O(N)``` (linear algorithm ) : describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set.
- ```O(N2) ``` (Polynomial algorithm) : represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set. 
- ```O(2N)  ``` (Exponential algorithm) : denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each additon to the input data set. The growth curve of an O(2N) function is exponential - starting off very shallow, then rising meteorically.
>  Doubling the size of the input data set has little effect on its growth as after a single iteration of the algorithm the data set will be halved and therefore on a par with an input data set half the size. This makes algorithms like binary search extremely efficient when dealing with large data sets.
